# SVG Logo Makerr

This is a Node.js command-line application that generates a logo based on user input and saves it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and then saves the generated SVG to a .svg file.

## User Story
- As a freelance web developer, 
- I want to generate a simple logo for my projects 
- So that I don't have to pay a graphic designer.


## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
- THEN I can enter up to three characters
- WHEN I am prompted for the text color
- THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- WHEN I am prompted for a shape
- THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
- WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
- THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
- THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
- AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
- WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
- THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered


## Approach
To build this application, we first identified the required functionality and created a list of tasks to be completed in order to meet the acceptance criteria. We decided to use Node.js for this project as it is a popular and efficient tool for building command-line applications.

The next step was to create a structure for the application, including the necessary files and directories. We then started working on the logic to prompt the user for input, validate the input, and generate the SVG file.

After completing the initial logic, we tested the application to ensure it met the acceptance criteria. We then made any necessary adjustments and added error handling to ensure the application was robust and user-friendly.
